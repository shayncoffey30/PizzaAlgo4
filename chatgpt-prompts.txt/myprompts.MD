Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, and quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software. It involves applying engineering principles to software creation to ensure it is reliable, efficient, maintainable, and meets user requirements. Software engineering encompasses a range of methodologies, tools, and practices that help manage the complexity of software development.

Key Concepts in Software Engineering
Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):

The SDLC is a process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software. Common models include:
Waterfall: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins.
Agile: An iterative approach that promotes flexible responses to change through incremental work cycles (sprints).
DevOps: Integrates development and operations to improve collaboration and productivity by automating workflows and infrastructure.
